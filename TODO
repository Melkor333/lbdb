- add new modules:
    - m_fido (scan Fido nodelist/pointlist)
    - extend m_passwd for NIS access (or create a separate module). 

- rewrite lbdb-fetchaddr, which becomes very slow when the database
  grows. Maybe a database backend or some expire mechanism which
  removes old entries from the list.
