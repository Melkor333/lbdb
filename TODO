- add new modules:
    - m_pgp2 (scan PGP 2.* keyring)
    - m_pgp5 (scan PGP 5.* keyring)
    - m_gpg (scan GnuPG keyring)
    - m_fido (scan Fido nodelist/pointlist)

- write a more expressive /etc/lbdb.rc

- rewrite lbdb-fetchaddr, which becomes very slow when the database
  grows. Maybe a database backend or some expire mechanism which
  removes old entries from the list.
