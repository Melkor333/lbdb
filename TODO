- Add new modules:
    - extend m_passwd for NIS access (or create a separate module).
    - Add m_ldap for LDAP access.
    - Add m_pgp6 for PGP 6.5.1.

- Make AWK=/usr/bin/awk the default for Debian (instead of
  /usr/bin/mawk), because /usr/bin/awk is handled by the alternates
  mechanism.

- Have a deep look into the locking mechanism.  Over NFS dotlocking
  may not be enough, it should be combined with fcntl() (this should
  be possible to disable via configure option).  This means that we
  may no longer use mutt_dotlock but always use a private
  lbdb_dotlock.

- Find out why fetchaddr sometimes runs forever on Solaris 2.6.

- Add manpage for configuration file lbdbrc(5) or something like this.
