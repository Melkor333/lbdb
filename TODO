- Add new modules:
    - Add m_ldap for LDAP access.
    - Add m_pgp6 for PGP 6.5.1.

- lbdb_dotlock: Have a deep look into the locking mechanism.  Over NFS
  dotlocking may not be enough, it should be combined with fcntl()
  (this should be possible to disable via configure option).  This
  means that we may no longer use mutt_dotlock but always use a
  private lbdb_dotlock.

- fetchaddr: Find out why fetchaddr sometimes runs forever on Solaris 2.6.

- Add man page for configuration file lbdbrc(5) or something like
  this.

- lbdbq: write some information about lbdbq and/or the used databases
  into the header line (at the moment this line is left empty).

- lbdbq should abort with non-zero exist code and a one line error
  messsage, if nothing matches (at the moment it returns 0).

- Think about a debug/log mechanism for lbdbq and the modules, so an
  error in a module doesn't imply lbdbq to fail but all other modules
  work as usual and the error messages (and debug informations) are
  written to the logfile (maybe ~/.lbdb/debug).

- lbdb-fetchaddr/m_inmail: Add some mechanism to avoid to remove
  m_inmail.list when the home partition is full or if you are over
  quota.

- lbdb-fetchaddr/m_inmail: Make the database file configurable.  This
  can be realized in lbdb-fetchaddr via a new option, while m_inmail
  needs a new lbdbrc-variable for this.

- munge/munge-keeporder: At the moment the mail address is the "unique
  key", so multiple lines with the same mail address but different
  real names are deduped to only one line (with the real name randomly
  chosen).  It may be a good idea to make the combination of mail
  address and real name the key.
