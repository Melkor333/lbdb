- Add new modules:
    - Add m_ldap for LDAP access.
    - Add m_pgp6 for PGP 6.5.1.

- Have a deep look into the locking mechanism.  Over NFS dotlocking
  may not be enough, it should be combined with fcntl() (this should
  be possible to disable via configure option).  This means that we
  may no longer use mutt_dotlock but always use a private
  lbdb_dotlock.

- Find out why fetchaddr sometimes runs forever on Solaris 2.6.

- Add man page for configuration file lbdbrc(5) or something like
  this.
