Installation notes
------------------

To install the Little Brother's database, type:

	./configure
	make install

Note that this will put quite a few auxiliary files into
/usr/local/lib.  You may want to put lbdb into a separate
directory hierarchy such as /usr/local/lbdb (use the
--prefix switch), or you may want to give it a different
libdir, such as /usr/local/lib/lbdb (use the --libdir
switch).
