Installation notes
------------------

To install the Little Brother's database, type:

	./configure
	make install

Note that this will put quite a few auxiliary files into
/usr/local/lib.  You may want to put lbdb into a separate directory
hierarchy such as /usr/local/lbdb (use the --prefix switch), or you
may want to give it a different libdir, such as /usr/local/lib/lbdb
(use the --libdir switch).

You need to have the Palm::PDB and Palm::Address Perl modules
installed to use the m_palm module.
