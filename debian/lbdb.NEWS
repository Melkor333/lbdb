lbdb (0.42) unstable; urgency=medium

  lbdb-fetchaddr/m_inmail default charset was changed to UTF-8.
  To avoid problems on upgrading, the database file name was changed from
  $HOME/.lbdb/m_inmail.list to $HOME/.lbdb/m_inmail.utf-8.  If you want
  to keep your old (ISO-8859-15 encoded) database, you can just append
  it to the new file by
     cd $HOME/.lbdb
     iconv -f iso-8859-15 -t utf-8 < m_inmail.list >> m_inmail.utf-8
