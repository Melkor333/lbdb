lbdb (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dotlock command from mutt 0.96.1 sources (without the SGID mail
    stuff) which is installed as lbdb_dotlock, when no mutt_dotlock can be 
    found. This doesn't change the Debian binary, because the Debian
    package depends on mutt which is compiled with mutt_dotlock in the
    Debian environment (because of "SGID mail")

lbdb (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added new modules:
    - m_passwd: looks into /etc/passwd for addresses
    - m_pgp2:   scans your PGP 2.* keyring for addresses
    - m_pgp5:   scans your PGP 5.* keyring for addresses
    - m_gpg:    scans your GnuPG keyring for addresses   
  * Made config directory autoconf configureable as @sysconfdir@ (this
    does not change anything for the Debian package).
  * Fixed trouble in configure.in noted by Fabrice Noilhan
    <noilhan@clipper.ens.fr>.

    created by broken development environment...

lbdb (0.13) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded lbdb.sl supplied by Thomas Roessler <roessler@guug.de>
  * Moved lbdb.sl to /usr/doc/lbdb/examples
  * Removed dependency to mutt-i (>= 0.94.10), because there was no mutt-i 
    >= 0.94.10, instead mutt-i was renamed to mutt in the time of adding
    the needed mutt_dotlock.
  * Create ~/.lbdb/m_inmail.list in lbdb-fetchaddr if it does not exist.
  * Fix manpage lbdb-fetchaddr(1) to refer to the correct db filename.
