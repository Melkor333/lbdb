lbdb (0.19.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version of m_pine by Gabor Fleischer <flocsy@mtesz.hu>: Now
    handles aliases without real names correct (by using a single space as
    the realname, so Mutt has not problem with this.
  * Add new helper program qpto8bit, which converts quoted-printable
    (according to RFC2047) to plain 8bit (without MIME header).  This is
    used by m_pine to decode quoted-printable in addressbooks to 8bit.
  * Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.2.0:
    - Evaluate DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS for -g and strip.
  * Upgrade to new debhepler:
    - Change to DH_COMPAT=2.
    - Add some dh_* calls to debian/rules.

lbdb (0.19.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove "-f" option from configure @AWK@ variable and manually add it,
    where it is needed, otherwise @AWK@ cannot be used for inline scripts.
  * Add new module m_pine, provided by Gabor FLEISCHER <flocsy@mtesz.hu>
    to search pine address books.
  * Fixed m_muttalias to additionally accept "foo@bar (Foo Bar)" style
    addresses and to ignore group aliases.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Fri, 23 Jun 2000 12:09:32 +0200

lbdb (0.19.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make dotlock.c compile on systems without snprintf() again.
  * Don't remove Makefile in clean target but only in distclean.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun, 28 May 2000 11:32:16 +0200

lbdb (0.19.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add new module m_muttalias, provided by Brian Salter-Duke
    <b_duke@lacebark.ntu.edu.au> to search mutt alias files for aliases.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sat, 27 May 2000 14:47:17 +0200

lbdb (0.19.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Give the dateformat to fetchaddr(1) using the -d option (instead of
    simply using argv[1]).
  * Give the dateformat to lbdb-fetchaddr(1) using the -d option.  If
    there is only one parameter, this is used as dateformat for backward
    compatibility.  Manpage adapted to this.
  * Remove DOTLOCK=/usr/bin/mutt_dotlock from ./configure environment.
    This is superfluous since --enable-lbdb-dotlock is used, but it
    doesn't cause problems (neither with mutt installed or deinstalled)
    (Closes: #64134).
  * Fixed typo in m_abook ("@$" instead of "$@").

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon, 22 May 2000 10:59:59 +0200

lbdb (0.19.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct dependencies:
    - No longer depend on mutt (only suggest it), we use lbdb_dotlock now,
      so #58188 is really closed now.
    - Depend on awk instead of mawk, because we use /usr/bin/awk, which
      can be any awk.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 10 May 2000 03:16:05 +0200

lbdb (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to standards version 3.1.1: Add Build-Depends.
  * Hardcode finger and mutt_dotlock in debian/rules, to avoid additional
    Build-Depends.
  * use safe_strdup() instead of strdup() which isn't available on Ultrix.
  * Add lbdb.spec by Horms <horms@vergenet.net>.
  * Update the version number in lbdb.spec via configure.
  * Add abook support based on an idea by Ross Campbell
    <rcampbel@us.oracle.com>.
  * Add NIS support based on an idea by Ross Campbell
    <rcampbel@us.oracle.com>.
  * Add --enable-lbdb-dotlock to configure options to force using of
    lbdb_dotlock (instead of using mutt_dotlock) and use this option for
    the Debian package (Closes: #58188).
  * Update FSF address in copyrights.
  * Update dotlock code from mutt 1.1.12.
  * Use /usr/bin/awk instead of /usr/bin/mawk in the Debian package
    (/usr/bin/awk is handled by alternates mechanism to point to the
    "optimal" awk replacement).
  * Speed up munge (nearly two times as fast as previous version).
  * Add option SORT_OUTPUT to lbdb.rc, which can be set to "false" or
    "no".  This implies that lbdbq doesn't sort the output but reverts its
    order, so the most recent addresses from m_inmail.list will be shown
    first.  Thanks to Andrew Over <aover@uq.net.au> for this idea.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon,  8 May 2000 19:23:16 +0200

lbdb (0.18.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Optimized m_gpg to use --with-colons.
  * Remove "Recommends: netstd" (Closes: #49397).
  * Add "Suggests: finger" and test in m_finger whether the finger command
    is available (don't do anything in m_finger, if finger isn't
    available).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun,  7 Nov 1999 02:51:52 +0100

lbdb (0.18.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in lbdb-fetchaddr.man.
  * Fixed typo on lbdbq.man (Closes: #48143).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun, 24 Oct 1999 02:45:46 +0200

lbdb (0.18.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * m_gpg no longer writes error messages to stderr, when the given search 
    string does not exist (Closes: #45422).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Sep 1999 20:40:02 +0200

lbdb (0.18.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added HP-UX support (by David Ellement <ellement@sdd.hp.com>): 
    - Try awk (in addition to mawk, gawk, nawk).
    - Don't use "if ! ..." in shell scripts, because ksh in HP-UX doesn't
      support this.
  * Make dotlock.c more portable.
  * Make Makefile.in much more portable.
  * Merge in changes of dotlock program from Mutt 0.96.6.
  * Upgraded Debian standards version to 3.0.1:
    - GPL now in /usr/share/common-licenses/
    - /usr/man -> /usr/share/man
  * Add -v and -h options to lbdbq and lbdb-fetchaddr which display the
    version of lbdb and a short help.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Sep 1999 11:42:19 +0200

lbdb (0.18.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Always build Debian binary with m_pgp2, m_pgp5 and m_gpg (ignoring
    whether the different PGP binaries are installed).
  * Merged in changes from Mutt's dotlock (CVS as of 1999-08-01).
  * Use "$@" instead of $1 in m_* files to allow `lbdb First Last' without 
    quotes around "First Last" (Closes: #42417).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed,  4 Aug 1999 00:44:58 +0200

lbdb (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Splited lbdb-fetchaddr.man off from lbdbq.man.
  * Moved lbdb-fetchaddr from $bindir to $libdir.
  * Added Fido module m_fido and nodelist2lbdb.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Jun 1999 18:22:53 +0200

lbdb (0.17.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded autoconf from 2.12 to 2.13.
    Get rid of `echo $PATH | sed "s/:/ /g"` in AC_PATH_PROC() macro,
    because this isn't needed and doesn't work with autoconf 2.13.
  * Removed word boundary check in m_inmail, because this is only
    available in GNU grep.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 25 May 1999 15:53:53 +0200

lbdb (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Delay munging of mails when using lbdb-fetchaddr/m_inmail by adding a
    new script lbdb-munge, which is run by lbdbq and can be run by cron
    additionally. Thanks to Enrico Zini <zinie@cs.unibo.it> for the base
    idea of this.
  * Made lbdb-fetchaddr Y2K compliant by changing the date format which is 
    written to the 3rd column of m_inmail.list to "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" (e.g.
    "1999-04-29 14:33").
  * Made date format in lbdb-fetchaddr runtime configurable as a command
    line parameter. If no date format is specified, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" is
    used as the default.
  * include getopt.h only if it is existing (using autoconf). 

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Apr 1999 12:22:13 +0200

lbdb (0.16.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed some bash, GNU-make, and GNU libc specials.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Apr 1999 19:11:24 +0200

lbdb (0.16.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * lbdb-fetchaddr: Create directory $HOME/.lbdb if it does not exist.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Apr 1999 13:12:04 +0200

lbdb (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dotlock command from mutt 0.96.1 sources (without the SGID mail
    stuff) which is installed as lbdb_dotlock, when no mutt_dotlock can be 
    found. This doesn't change the Debian binary, because the Debian
    package depends on mutt which is compiled with mutt_dotlock in the
    Debian environment (because of "SGID mail")

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Apr 1999 19:24:26 +0200

lbdb (0.15.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * m_passwd: give UID in comment field.
  * m_gpg: now only return addresses which match query. Closes #33672.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun, 21 Feb 1999 18:55:45 +0100

lbdb (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added new modules:
    - m_passwd: looks into /etc/passwd for addresses
    - m_pgp2:   scans your PGP 2.* keyring for addresses
    - m_pgp5:   scans your PGP 5.* keyring for addresses
    - m_gpg:    scans your GnuPG keyring for addresses   
  * Made config directory autoconf configureable as @sysconfdir@ (this
    does not change anything for the Debian package).
  * Fixed trouble in configure.in noted by Fabrice Noilhan
    <noilhan@clipper.ens.fr>.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Feb 1999 16:49:48 +0100

lbdb (0.14.1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed wrong mawk path (/usr/bin//mawk instead of /usr/bin/mawk)
    created by broken development environment...

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jan 1999 19:03:44 +0100

lbdb (0.14) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * fetchaddr converts the domain part of mail addresses to lowercase, to
    beware of duplicates in m_inmail.list. Closes #31989

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sat, 16 Jan 1999 21:21:40 +0100

lbdb (0.13) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded lbdb.sl supplied by Thomas Roessler <roessler@guug.de>
  * Moved lbdb.sl to /usr/doc/lbdb/examples
  * Removed dependency to mutt-i (>= 0.94.10), because there was no mutt-i 
    >= 0.94.10, instead mutt-i was renamed to mutt in the time of adding
    the needed mutt_dotlock.
  * Create ~/.lbdb/m_inmail.list in lbdb-fetchaddr if it does not exist.
  * Fix manpage lbdb-fetchaddr(1) to refer to the correct db filename.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Jan 1999 00:09:36 +0100

lbdb (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian maintainer took over the maintenance of the upstream packet.
  * lbdbq manpage moved to main packet.
  * made @libdir@ configurable in lbdbq manpage.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Nov 1998 21:30:33 +0100

lbdb (0.11-3) unstable; urgency=low
